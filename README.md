##   Puzzle & thinking game 

A puzzle game challenging players to think and act creatively while thinking in more dimensions than 2. This game contains pushable blocks, hazzards, and buttons. This game demonstates programming skill through its complexity and creative solutions to dealing with 4D objects and their projection onto 2D play areas. It should be fun, Difficult, and thought provolking.

### Difficulties or opportunities you encountered along the way.

The toughest part was mostly the level design.
  This just takes a lot of time.
For a while cubes could be pushed through wall to turn them to buttons.
  As you might know things are things and they often colide, but unoften combine to a new form.

### Most interesting piece of your code and explanation for what it does.

```java
{{
      {{0,0,1,0},  {0,0,1,0},  {1,0,0,0},  {0,1,0,1}},
      {{1,1,0,0},  {0,0,0,1},  {0,1,1,1},  {0,0,1,0}},
      {{0,0,0,1},  {0,1,1,0},  {1,0,0,0},  {0,1,0,1}},
      {{1,0,0,1},  {0,0,1,1},  {0,1,1,0},  {0,0,1,0}}},
      {
      {{0,1,1,1},  {1,0,0,1},  {1,1,0,1},  {0,0,1,0}},
      {{0,1,0,0},  {1,1,1,0},  {1,2,1,1},  {0,1,0,1}},
      {{1,0,1,1},  {1,1,0,0},  {0,0,1,1},  {1,1,0,1}},
      {{0,0,1,0},  {0,1,0,1},  {1,1,0,1},  {0,0,1,1}}},
      {
      {{0,0,1,1},  {0,1,1,0},  {1,0,1,1},  {0,1,1,0}},
      {{1,1,0,1},  {0,0,1,1},  {1,1,0,0},  {1,0,1,1}},
      {{0,1,0,0},  {1,0,1,0},  {1,1,0,1},  {1,1,1,0}},
      {{0,0,0,1},  {0,1,1,0},  {0,0,1,1},  {1,0,0,0}}},
      {
      {{1,0,0,0},  {0,1,1,1},  {1,1,0,1},  {0,1,0,0}},
      {{0,0,1,0},  {1,1,1,0},  {0,1,0,0},  {1,0,1,1}},
      {{0,0,1,0},  {1,1,0,1},  {0,1,1,0},  {1,0,0,1}},
      {{1,1,1,0},  {1,0,0,1},  {0,0,1,0},  {0,1,1,1}}}};
